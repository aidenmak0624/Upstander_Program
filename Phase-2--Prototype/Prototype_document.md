## Project Description

### Purpose:
The purpose of this project is to create an interactive, AI-driven platform that educates and empowers users to become upstanders—individuals who take action to support others in difficult social situations. The app leverages AI to tailor a personalized journey for each user, guiding them through three crucial phases:

1. **Recognizing Injustice:** Helping users identify and understand social issues like bullying, discrimination, and harassment.
2. **Discovering Personal Strengths:** Enabling users to uncover their unique strengths and talents through self-assessment tools and reflective exercises.
3. **Applying Strengths to Effect Change:** Providing actionable advice, scenarios, and resources to help users apply their strengths in real-world situations.

By customizing content to match users’ unique backgrounds and interests, this program transforms the abstract concept of human rights into a personal call to action, empowering every individual to see themselves as capable and influential advocates for change.

### Target Audience:
**Primary Users:** Individuals (Students) interested in learning about upstanders and improving their ability to respond to social challenges.

### Key Features:
1. **Interactive Learning Modules:**
   - Learn about the history and importance of upstanders through quizzes, games, and multimedia content.
   - Explore real stories from the Human Rights Museum with analysis of key strengths.
   
2. **Personal Strength Survey:**
   - A self-assessment tool to help users identify their strengths and how to apply them in real-life situations.

3. **Scenario Generation with AI:**
   - AI-powered advice for handling specific social situations (e.g., bullying, workplace harassment).
   - Role-playing simulations to practice responses.

4. **Community Story Sharing:**
   - Users can share their personal experiences and read stories from others in a supportive community space.

5. **Event and Resource Hub:**
   - A calendar of upcoming events (e.g., workshops, seminars) and a library of resources (e.g., mental health hotlines, anti-bullying guides).

## Potential Impact

The website’s streamlined access makes it easier to promote and engage with the project, allowing users to quickly find the resources they need. Immediate responses and personalized 1-to-1 experiences ensure deeper engagement. The **Know-Tell-Act** concept encourages students to explore human rights issues, communicate their findings, and take meaningful action. This process fosters critical thinking and empowers students to act, while facilitating easy booking for the program. It's an innovative approach to both learning and creating real-world impact.
