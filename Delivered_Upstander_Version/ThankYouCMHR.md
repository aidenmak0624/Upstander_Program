# Thank You – AI-Upstander Project Collaboration

Dear CMHR Team,

We wanted to extend my heartfelt thanks to Ben and Scott at the Canadian Museum for Human Rights for the opportunity to collaborate on the **AI-Upstander** project. It has been a truly rewarding experience to contribute to a project with such meaningful impact, and I’ve learned a great deal through this partnership.

Your guidance, feedback, and support throughout the term have been invaluable, and we greatly appreciate the trust you placed in us to bring this proof of concept to life. Working alongside your team has deepened my understanding of both the technical and human-centered aspects of creating tools for positive social change.

Thank you once again for this opportunity, and we look forward to seeing how the AI-Upstander project continues to grow in the future.

Warm regards,  
**Rafia and Chin**
