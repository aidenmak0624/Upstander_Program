# Feedback & Recommendations

## Balance Open-Ended AI Interactions with Guided Prompts

- **Technical Considerations:**
  - Ensure AI responses are grounded in factual Upstander content to avoid inaccuracies.
  - Use sentiment analysis or pre-defined response buckets to handle diverse inputs.

- **User Experience:**
  - Test prototypes with peers to identify friction points (e.g., wacky/irrelevant AI responses).
  - Consider hybrid approaches (e.g., AI-generated prompts with user-selectable buttons).

# Challenges Highlighted

- **Open-Ended AI Risks:** Unconstrained inputs may lead to irrelevant or inaccurate responses.
- **Content Accuracy:** Need to clarify when AI-generated content is fictional vs. factual.

# Next Steps

- **Refinement:**
  - **Rafia:** Expand chat interfaceâ€™s open-ended capabilities while maintaining a guided structure.
  - **Chin:** Focus on a single component (e.g., strength assessment) for deeper development.

- **Testing:** Conduct user testing to evaluate engagement and identify improvements.
- **Next Check-In:** Scheduled before the final presentation in early April.
