# Project Kick-off Meeting Notes (30 January, 2025)

## Project Proposal Feedback

- The proposal was well-structured but ambitious for the available timeline.
- Focus on a **minimum viable product (MVP)** rather than trying to implement too many features at once.
- The team emphasized the importance of choosing a **single critical feature** and ensuring it works effectively before expanding.

## How can we integrate AI?

Several ideas were considered:

- **AI-driven interactions**: Could include chatbots, content recommendations, or personalized learning experiences.
- **Static curated content vs. Dynamic AI-generated content**: Balancing pre-existing educational material with interactive AI elements.
- **Ensuring meaningful user engagement** rather than simply implementing AI for novelty.

## Target User Experience

The project aims to help users explore personal strengths and understand the concept of being an "upstander." The experience could take different forms:

- **Individual-focused**: A personal exploration of values, ethics, and historical examples of upstanders.
- **Social experience**: A collaborative or community-driven approach, possibly allowing users to compare insights or connect through discussions.

## Available Data & Resources

The project will leverage several key resources to inform content:

- **70+ page gallery overview document**: Provides insights into the museum’s layout and exhibits.
- **Universal Access Points (UAPs)**: Data source for specific access points relevant to the user experience.
- **Educational content from the museum’s education team**: Includes materials related to the upstander program.

## Next Steps

1. Review available data sources to determine how they can be integrated into the project.
2. Prioritize a core feature to ensure feasibility within the given timeframe.
3. Decide on the engagement model (individual vs. social experience).
