# AI-Driven Personalized Journey for the Upstander Program

## Overview

This project aims to enhance the **Canadian Museum for Human Rights (CMHR)** Upstander Program by integrating **AI-driven personalization** to create a tailored, interactive experience for users. The goal is to deepen users' connection with human rights issues, inspire them to recognize injustices, identify their strengths, and take action. The project leverages **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and other AI techniques to provide personalized recommendations and interactive experiences, both online and in-gallery.

## Project Goals

- **Enhance User Engagement**: Create a personalized journey through the Upstander Program using AI to tailor content based on user interests and strengths.
- **Interactive Experience**: Develop an AI-driven chatbot that guides users through the program, offering location-specific information and interactive elements.
- **Empower Users**: Encourage users to take action on human rights issues by providing them with relevant, personalized content and calls to action.

## Key Features

- **AI-Driven Chatbot**: A conversational AI chatbot that interacts with users, asks about their interests, and provides personalized recommendations.
- **Personalized Recommendations**: Tailored content based on user inputs, such as interests, strengths, and preferred learning styles.
  
## Chatbot Design Principles

- **Defined Persona**: Establishing a specific attitude and communication style for the chatbot.

- **Operational Rules**: Implementing clear guidelines the chatbot must follow.

- **Adaptive Prompting**: Using selective and multi-stage prompts, where the instructions given to the AI change based on the user's choices or the current stage of the conversation.

- **Guided Interaction**: Providing users with options or suggestions to steer the conversation effectively.

- **Hybrid Response Strategy**: Combining pre-defined (default) answers for guaranteed accuracy on specific topics with AI-generated responses to maintain a natural and appropriate conversational tone.


## Technologies Used

- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: For building the conversational AI chatbot.
- **Google's Gemini flash2.0 API**: To power the chatbot interactions.
- **Pandas**: For processing and analyzing UAP data.
- **Flask**: For building the backend server.
- **Other Libraries**: Additional Python libraries for data processing, recommendation systems, and user interface development.

## Project Phases

1. **Research and Planning (Completed on 20 February)**:
   - Analyzed the existing Upstander Program and identified key requirements.
   - Conducted stakeholder interviews to understand user needs.
   - Researched AI techniques suitable for personalization.
   - Developed detailed project specifications and a timeline.

2. **Initial Development and Prototyping (In progress, targeted to be complete on 18 March)**:
   - Implement foundational features, such as data processing and content integration.
   - Develop a basic chatbot for testing AI feasibility.
   - Create a prototype for user feedback.

3. **Refinement and Feature Expansion**:
   - Refine the prototype based on user feedback.
   - Add advanced features like personalized recommendations and multi-platform compatibility.
   - Implement interactions tailored for different contexts (in-gallery, online, classrooms).

4. **Testing and Finalization**:
   - Iterate on the design and implementation to address issues.
   - Test the final product for stability and usability.
   - Finalize features for the final presentation.

5. **Final Presentation and Delivery**:
   - Prepare a polished demo of the AI-driven Upstander Program journey.
   - Deliver the final product with documentation and user guides.

## Deliverables

- **AI-Driven Personalized Journey**: A functional AI system that tailors the userâ€™s journey through the Upstander Program.
- **User Interface (UI)**: An intuitive interface for users to engage with the program online, in-gallery, or in classrooms.
- **Final Presentation**: A comprehensive presentation showcasing the AI journey, key learnings, and outcomes.

## Stretch Goals

- **Multilingual Support**: Implement additional features to make the program accessible to a wider audience.
- **Integration with Other Educational Tools**: Develop a version of the AI journey that can integrate with other platforms used by the museum.

## Shrink Goals

- **Minimum Viable Product (MVP)**: A working prototype of the personalized AI journey with a focus on one or two key interactions (e.g., a simple chatbot guiding users through a basic version of the program).

## Future Development Roadmap

Our plans for enhancing the chatbot include:

- **Database Enhancement**: Improving the accuracy and expanding the scope of the underlying knowledge base.

- **Efficient Information Retrieval**: Implementing a database-selective prompt structure, allowing the chatbot to draw information only from relevant parts of the database for a given query, rather than the entire dataset.

- **Personalization**: Introducing an initial stage to identify user characteristics (like age or occupation) to tailor the conversation for a more personalized experience.

## Timeline and Phases Delay

The project timeline has experienced some delays due to the postponed kick-off meeting and delays in receiving the necessary data. As a result, the planned phases have been pushed back, and certain tasks that depend on the availability of this data are also delayed. We are actively working to catch up and ensure that the remaining tasks will be completed according to the adjusted timeline. We appreciate your understanding and will keep all stakeholders updated on any further changes.
