# AI-driven Upstander Program

## Project Overview
The **AI-driven Upstander Program** aims to create an interactive platform that empowers individuals—particularly students—to become upstanders: people who take proactive action in challenging social situations. This project leverages artificial intelligence (AI) to guide users through three transformative phases:

1. **Recognizing Injustice**: Help users identify and understand social issues such as bullying, discrimination, and harassment.
2. **Discovering Personal Strengths**: Provide tools for users to reflect on their unique talents and capabilities through self-assessment exercises.
3. **Applying Strengths for Change**: Offer actionable advice, scenarios, and resources to help users apply their personal strengths in real-world situations.

By tailoring content to each user's background, interests, and needs, this program transforms human rights education into a deeply personal and empowering experience, inspiring users to become active advocates for social change.

## Key Features
- **Interactive Learning Modules**: Engage with quizzes, games, and multimedia content that explore the history and impact of upstanders.
- **Personal Strength Survey**: A self-assessment tool that helps users discover their strengths and how to leverage them in social situations.
- **AI-Powered Scenario Generation**: Get personalized advice and role-playing simulations for handling real-world situations like bullying or workplace harassment.
- **Community Story Sharing**: A space for users to share their personal stories, experiences, and insights, while reading and commenting on others' contributions.
- **Event and Resource Hub**: Stay informed with a calendar of upcoming events, workshops, and access to important resources like mental health hotlines and anti-bullying guides.

## Purpose and Impact
This platform not only provides educational content but also fosters a sense of personal responsibility and empowerment. By integrating AI to offer tailored experiences, the program deepens engagement with human rights issues and encourages students to reflect on how they can act in their own lives. The **Know-Tell-Act** model of the program promotes critical thinking, meaningful communication, and real-world action, making it a powerful tool for social change.
